                Performance
                    make changes that impact user, improving system
                Preventive
                    enhance maintainability
                    make future tansistion possible
                Groomative
                    use more efficient or simpler components
                    rename data
                    change authorization
                    backups

            support interface00
                evaluative
                    reviewing/inspecting program code and documentation

                consulitive
                    cost and length
                    personnel help desk
                    customers are assisted in preparing work requests
                    provide expert knowledge about stuff
                training - steakholders about implementation


    regression testing - after each change that introduces to ensure no unintended break

start looking for projects:
must already exist and be open source MIT/BSD/Apache/LGPL/GPL

check out rust and memory saftey




Testing:
    the goal of testing is demonstrating that software meets requirements.
    validation testing - tests that result is correct
    defect testing - finding input sequences that lead to incorrect behavior
        should also check for emergent behavior as much as possible



validation - are we building the right thing?
verification - are we building it correctly

unit testing - testing individual classes and methods
component testing - testing component interfaces

fuzz testing - providing random input in order to find errors

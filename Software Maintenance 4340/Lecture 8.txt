Evolution vs Maintenance
    evolution 1965 to desctibe growth characteristics
        progressing sofgware from a lesser, simpler or worse state to a higher state.
    maintenance 1976 for these three 
        Corrective
        Adaptive
        Perfective
        preventing software from failing

    3 types of programs     
        S-type: specification
            approximations estimates based of requirments
            no evolution, creates a new problem
            example: calculate gcf or lcf
        P-type
            real world problems with inperfect solutions
            evolution envisioned
            example: playing chess
        E-type 
            embedded system. software becomes part of the world around it

    8 laws
        1. continuance
        2. growing complexity
        3. self regulation
        4. conservation of organizational stability

    impact anaylisis:
        traceablility - requirments, design, code, test cases are identified
        dependability - call graph-based or dependancy graph-based
            find dependancy in code

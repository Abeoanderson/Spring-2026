Lecture 3:

1960s - software crisis
    hardware progressed faster then software so software had to catch up
    lunar lander code was hella buggy and failed frequently
    how can we make scalable reliable code?

Distributed systems - sharing is caring, pay for what you use  

shared responsibility model
    customer
        customer data
        platform, app, id and access Managementos network firewall config
        other saftey
    AWS
        software
            compute 
            storeage
            hardware

    cloud needs
        compute
        storeage
        network
        security


Acceptance testing - know when your done

Intro to Software as a service

ghostie - checkout

zen - checkout

tailwind - css 

owning code?

kubernetes K8 - OS of the cloud
    Ingress
        -connect via web surver and internet
        -host on a web server
    compute
        -CPU and RAM
    storeage
        -persistance
    Node Management
        -High availability 
    Container Orchestration


http vs http

Agile is not nowl, nor was it ever water fall discussion?

Test Driven Development

Archetecture Jams:
    be mindful
    start with a goal
    lay out constraints and principles


CAP Theorem, you can have 2 outa 3
    Consistency
        all clients no matter where they connect see the same data at the same time
        instantanious communication: - websockets
    Availability
        every request you make to a part thats not broken gets a response
        200 - ok
        401 - unathorized
        404 - unavailable
        500s - server error
    Partition Tolerance
        the ability for the system to keep operating even if parts become seperated or removed

Brewers Conjecture Podcast:
    Eric Brewer - CAP theorum 
        cant have all three

    Practical constraint that forces engineers to choose tradeoffs

    Consistency - atomic data objects
        all operations appear to occur in an instant all at once.
        perfect consistant data
    availability - every request must respond
        even if their are network problems a response is still required
    Partition Tolerance 
        every issue is a separation 
        when the internet was made it was designed to be a distributed system

    asynchronous network   
        no global clock, servers make decisions independendtly
            diffference between slow and lost message is indistinguisable

    partially syncrhouns network 
        allow for timeouts

    T-Connected consistancy
        consistant after t time
        promise to be perfectly atomicly consistent when the model is stable
        if its stable for t time it snaps back


    unavoidable tradeoffs

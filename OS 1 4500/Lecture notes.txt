Understand OS abstraction
Analyze system resource Management
Apply Concurrency Fundamentals
introduce systems security

OS overview:
read 1.1-1.2

computers have 2 modes
user mode
kernal mode

transitions between user/kernal
    hardware interrupt
    system call
    exception


different types of OS   
    batch processing - process job one at a time
    time sharing OS - process mulitple jobs in round robin
    real-time OS - still time-sharing, but has deadlines for certain jobs
    distributed OS - multiple computers run a single copy of OS
    embedded OS - runs on cell phones and PDA's


Kernel is the heart of OS

A monolithic kernel is a model where all OS services run in kernel mode. 
The pros of this are its faster due to the simple communication. The cons 
are that its much larger and more complex system, so one bug or error can 
crash the whole system and make maintaining/debugging very difficult

A microkernal is a model where only essential services run in kernel mode, 
like IPC, scheduling, and basic memory; the other functions run in user mode. 
The pros of this is its more stable/secure because faults are isolated. 
The cons are that it is slower and more work for IPC 

Register
Cache
RAM (Memory)
    SSD
    HDD
    FLASH
    DVD


    Hardware device events can be processed though polling interupt and DMA
    polling is checking every so often for interrupt
    interupt is like a door bell
    Dynamic access is like having an assistant to handle interrupt



Processes(programs):
    processes are programs running by the cpu. processes are init from programs and are 
    given space and time sharing by cpu. 

    termination
        normal exit(voluntary)
        Error Exit(voluntary)
        Killed by another process(involuntary)


how many states can a process have 
    TASk_RUNNING
    TASK_INTERRUPTSBLE
    EXIT_ZOMBIE
    EXIT_DEAD


Project 1 is making a kernal app with c, should be light, but dont procrastinate it


processs have 3 states
    ready
    running
    blocked

pcb 
    process control block
    zombie process
        process finishes execution(called exit)


multicore/threaded cpu, parral processing = hardware

pc scheduling
    FCFS

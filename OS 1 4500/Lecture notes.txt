Understand OS abstraction
Analyze system resource Management
Apply Concurrency Fundamentals
introduce systems security

OS overview:
read 1.1-1.2

computers have 2 modes
user mode
kernal mode

transitions between user/kernal
    hardware interrupt
    system call
    exception


different types of OS   
    batch processing - process job one at a time
    time sharing OS - process mulitple jobs in round robin
    real-time OS - still time-sharing, but has deadlines for certain jobs
    distributed OS - multiple computers run a single copy of OS
    embedded OS - runs on cell phones and PDA's


Kernel is the heart of OS

Register
Cache
RAM (Memory)
    SSD
    HDD
    FLASH
    DVD


    Hardware device events can be processed though polling interupt and DMA
    polling is checking every so often for interrupt
    interupt is like a door bell
    Dynamic access is like having an assistant to handle interrupt
